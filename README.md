## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, we had to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, we will took a static design that lacked accessibility and we needed to convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. We had to add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for our users.

### Specification

We have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn’t included any standard accessibility features, and it didin’t work offline at all. Our job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. We had to possibly maintain the use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript code added. 

### How to use the app?

1. Clone this repository to your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

3. Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.
